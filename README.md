An R package for ecological and macroecological analyses of the deep
time fossil record

## Installation

EcoPast (GPL-2) relies on some functions provided by other packages.
Some of these packages cannot be directly installed along with EcoPast
because they are distributed under different license types.

chronosphere and rangeBuilder, available on CRAN, can be installed by
means of the common installation procedure in R.

## Important Note

EcoPast uses dependencies with ACM license, we address users to the
authors of packages rangeBuilder, alphahull, and tripack for commercial
use.
